The Meshtastic SAME EAS Alerter is a lightweight tool designed to forward warnings, emergencies, or statements sent over the air to a local Meshtastic network. It operates without needing a WiFi connection. The setup involves connecting the hosting computer to an RTL SDR via USB and to a running Meshtastic node via serial.

## Meshtastic Setup üìª
- All alerts will be sent to the primary channel (channel number 0)       
- Set a secondary channel (channel 1) to be the logger channel, either by creating a different name for it or some sort of encryption   
  - All test alerts will be sent to channel 1 so be sure to configure it   
- The connected node should have a great line of sight of other nodes to effectively relay alerts
